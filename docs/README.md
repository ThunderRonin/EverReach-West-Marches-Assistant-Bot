## � Current Status

### Project Completion: **60% of Battle Plan** ✅

**Phases Completed**:
- ✅ **Phase 1-5**: Bug fixes, configuration, validation, error handling, database optimization (32/63 tasks)
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Guards & authorization (5/5 tasks)
- ✅ **Phase 7** (Partial): Zod runtime validation for JSON payloads (4/4 scoped tasks)
- ❌ **Phases 8-12**: Deliberately skipped (enterprise patterns not needed for hobby project)

**Build Status**: ✅ Clean (2.76s, zero errors)
**Database Status**: ✅ 10 performance indexes live in production
**Authorization**: ✅ Guard-based access control on all sensitive commands
**Validation**: ✅ Zod schemas for JSON payload runtime validation

### Key Achievements
