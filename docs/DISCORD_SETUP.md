# Discord Bot Setup Guide

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to configure your bot in Discord Developer Portal  
**Issue**: Bot offline, no commands registered

---

## 🤖 Discord Developer Portal Setup

### Step 1: Access Discord Developer Portal

1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Log in with your Discord account
3. Click **"New Application"** (or select existing application)
4. Give it a name (e.g., "EverReach Assistant")
5. Click **"Create"**

---

### Step 2: Configure Bot Settings

#### 2.1 General Information
1. Click on your application
2. Go to **"General Information"** tab
3. Copy your **"Application ID"** (this is your `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`)
4. (Optional) Add an app icon and description

#### 2.2 Create/Configure Bot
1. Click **"Bot"** in the left sidebar
2. If no bot exists, click **"Add Bot"** → **"Yes, do it!"**
3. Under **"Token"** section:
   - Click **"Reset Token"** (or "Copy" if first time)
   - **⚠️ Copy this token immediately** - you won't see it again!
   - This is your `DISCORD_TOKEN`

#### 2.3 Bot Permissions (Important!)
Still on the Bot page, scroll down to **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**:

**Enable these intents:**
- ✅ **Server Members Intent** (if you need member info)
- ✅ **Message Content Intent** (if bot needs to read messages)
- ⚠️ **Presence Intent** (only if needed)

**Bot Settings:**
- ✅ **Public Bot** - ON (if you want others to invite it)
- ❌ **Requires OAuth2 Code Grant** - OFF

---

### Step 3: OAuth2 Configuration

#### 3.1 Set OAuth2 URL Generator
1. Click **"OAuth2"** → **"URL Generator"** in left sidebar

#### 3.2 Select Scopes
Check these boxes under **SCOPES**:
- ✅ **bot**
- ✅ **applications.commands**

#### 3.3 Select Bot Permissions
Under **BOT PERMISSIONS**, check:

**General Permissions:**
- ✅ **Read Messages/View Channels**

**Text Permissions:**
- ✅ **Send Messages**
- ✅ **Send Messages in Threads**
- ✅ **Embed Links**
- ✅ **Attach Files**
- ✅ **Read Message History**
- ✅ **Add Reactions**
- ✅ **Use Slash Commands**

**Calculated Permissions Value:** (will be displayed at bottom)
Copy this number or use the generated URL below.

#### 3.4 Copy Generated URL
At the bottom, you'll see a **"GENERATED URL"**
- Copy this URL
- **This is your invite link!**

---

### Step 4: Invite Bot to Your Server

1. **Paste the generated URL** into your browser
2. Select the server you want to add the bot to
   - You must have **"Manage Server"** permission
3. Click **"Continue"**
4. **Review permissions** (make sure all are checked)
5. Click **"Authorize"**
6. Complete the captcha
7. ✅ Bot should now appear in your server's member list

**Expected Result:** Bot appears **OFFLINE** (gray) - this is normal until you start it!

---

### Step 5: Get Your Server/Guild ID

#### Enable Developer Mode in Discord:
1. Open Discord app
2. Click **⚙️ User Settings** (bottom left)
3. Go to **"Advanced"** (under "App Settings")
4. Enable **"Developer Mode"**
5. Click **"✓"** to save

#### Get Guild ID:
1. Right-click on your server icon (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Copy Server ID"**
3. This is your `GUILD_ID_DEV`

---

### Step 6: Get Startup Notification Channel ID (Optional)

**Purpose**: Bot will send a "Hello World!" message when it starts up

#### Get Channel ID:
1. Make sure **Developer Mode** is enabled (see Step 5)
2. Right-click on a channel (e.g., #bot-logs or #general)
3. Click **"Copy Channel ID"**
4. This is your `STARTUP_CHANNEL_ID`

**Recommended**: Create a dedicated `#bot-logs` channel for bot notifications

---

### Step 7: Configure Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Discord Configuration
# Copy these from Discord Developer Portal
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
GUILD_ID_DEV=YOUR_SERVER_ID_HERE

# Optional: Startup Notification Channel
# Bot will send a message here when it starts (great for monitoring!)
STARTUP_CHANNEL_ID=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE

# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/data/database.db"

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional: AI Embeddings (for notes feature)
# EMBEDDING_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings
# EMBEDDING_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

**⚠️ Security Notes:**
- ✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ❌ NEVER commit tokens to git
- ❌ NEVER share your bot token
- ⚠️ If token is leaked, reset it immediately in Discord Portal

---

### Step 8: Start Your Bot

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
yarn install

# Generate Prisma client
yarn prisma:generate

# Run database migrations
yarn prisma:migrate

# Start the bot
yarn dev
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
[Bootstrap] 🚀 EverReach Assistant Discord Bot starting...
[Bootstrap] 📊 Environment: development
[DiscordService] Started refreshing application (/) commands.
[DiscordService] Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.
[DiscordClient] Discord bot logged in as YourBot#1234!
[DiscordClient] ✅ Startup notification sent to channel 123456789
```

---

### Step 9: Verify Bot is Online

1. **Check Discord Server:**
   - Bot should now show as **ONLINE** (green dot)
   - Bot should appear in member list

2. **Check Startup Message** (if STARTUP_CHANNEL_ID configured):
   - Look in your configured channel
   - You should see a green embed message:
     ```
     🤖 Bot Started Successfully
     EverReach Assistant is now online and ready!
     Status: ✅ Connected
     Version: 1.0.0
     Environment: development
     ```

3. **Test Slash Commands:**
   - Type `/` in any channel
   - You should see your bot's commands in the list
   - Commands should include:
     - `/register`
     - `/inv`
     - `/shop`
     - `/buy`
     - `/history`
     - `/trade`
     - `/auction`
     - `/note`

4. **Test a Command:**
   ```
   /register TestCharacter
   ```
   - Bot should respond (might be ephemeral - only you see it)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot Still Offline

**Check:**
1. ✅ Bot token is correct in `.env`
2. ✅ No spaces or quotes around token
3. ✅ `.env` file is in project root
4. ✅ Bot is started (`yarn dev`)
5. ✅ No error messages in console

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop the bot (Ctrl+C)
# Verify .env file
cat .env | grep DISCORD_TOKEN

# Restart
yarn dev
```

---

### Issue: No Slash Commands Showing

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Bot invited without `applications.commands` scope
2. ❌ Commands not registered (check console logs)
3. ❌ Discord cache (wait 5 minutes or restart Discord)

**Solution 1: Re-invite bot with correct permissions**
1. Generate new invite URL (Step 3)
2. Make sure ✅ **applications.commands** is checked
3. Use new URL to re-invite bot

**Solution 2: Force Discord refresh**
```
# Windows/Linux: Ctrl+R
# Mac: Cmd+R
# Or completely restart Discord app
```

**Solution 3: Check bot logs**
```bash
# Look for this in console:
# [DiscordService] Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.
```

---

### Issue: Commands Show But Don't Work

**Check:**
1. ✅ Bot has permissions in the channel
2. ✅ Bot role is above other roles (if role restrictions)
3. ✅ Check bot console for errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Server Settings → Roles
# Drag bot role higher in the list
# Check channel permissions for bot role
```

---

### Issue: "Invalid Token" Error

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Discord Developer Portal
2. Bot → Token → **"Reset Token"**
3. Copy NEW token
4. Update `.env` file
5. Restart bot

---

### Issue: "Missing Access" or "Missing Permissions"

**Check Channel Permissions:**
1. Right-click channel → **"Edit Channel"**
2. Go to **"Permissions"** tab
3. Click **"+"** → Select your bot role
4. Enable:
   - ✅ View Channel
   - ✅ Send Messages
   - ✅ Embed Links
   - ✅ Use Slash Commands

---
